The Methodogy and step to decipher the cyphertex
I empliment the task1.py function to do the work for me.
I XOR c1bin and c2bin to got the key.
In this case I use dtrabi07_2.txt and dtrabi07_3 as c1bin and C2bin.
I then convert it to a bytearray to make the task easy.
And I XOR my guessbin with the first XOR at offset range.
The range of the offset is as same of the length of the cyphertext
I print out some Dec number of the ouput
I then convert the result in the his ASCII code 
The words that I guess right are in my_guess.txt. 

Task 2
This is how I did my decoding 
File 1
"But the fact that

line 1: "The world was mine
line 2: "world was mine"
Line 12: "livat"
line 26: "iuses"
line 32: "wrunt"
line 58: "me"
line 31: are m
line 38  "mchod"

line 3: "esire"
line 3 :  "convi"
line 2 : " convince "
line 5:  " is "

File 2: 
Line 12: " the "
line 32: " the " 

File 3
line 58 : " the "
line 26 : " the "
line 38: " " then b"

File 4
line 4 : 3 " the"
line 2 : "t the fact"

file 5
line 2:"world was mine"

file 6
line 5: he f

task 1
The function should return a partial decoding of cypertest1 
depending on if the guess is correct.
